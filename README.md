# Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website built with Sphinx and the Furo theme. Itâ€™s designed to showcase my professional background, technical skills, and projects. The site is automatically built and deployed to GitHub Pages via a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

## Features

- **Sphinx-based Documentation:** Written in reStructuredText with optional Markdown support via `myst_parser`.
- **Modern Design:** Uses the [Furo](https://pradyunsg.me/furo/) theme for a clean and responsive look.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** GitHub Actions builds the site and deploys it to the `gh-pages` branch automatically.
- **Structured Content:** Includes sections such as Home, About, Projects, and Contact.
